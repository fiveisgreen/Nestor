<h1> Nestor the Investor </h1>
An investment and trading analysis program for private use <br/>
(c) Souvik Das 2017 <br/> <br/>
<hr/>

<b> Depends on </b>
<ul>
 <li> ROOT (https://root.cern.ch/) </li>
 <li> https://www.alphavantage.co/ </li>
</ul>
<hr/>

<b> Functionality </b> <br/>
<p> Nestor downloads stocks, mutual funds and (crypto-)currency trading data from https://www.alphavantage.co/ and generates candlestick plots
with various moving averages to guide my trades and investments. Various technical indicators are implemented from scratch and combined
in proprietary strategies algorithms to guide my trading intuition. </p>

<p> A variation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluctuation-dissipation_theorem"><b>Fluctuation Dissipation Theorem</b></a>
formulated for the detailed balance of a stock is used to gauge its susceptibility market forces and sentiments. </p>

<p> While most of the action happens in the terminal, Nestor also generates an HTML dashboard with the stocks, funds and currencies 
I'm interested in as shown in the screenshot below. </p>
